Boomer Basic Server Website Template

===========================================================================

This is my attempt to make a very basic web server template written in GO with the goal of trying to avoid Javascript and only use GO instead for performance and security.

Possibly a silly goal, but that won't stop me from doing it. If it ends up looking like a classic Boomer website from the 90s, that's fine by me... call me oppsessive, 
but I would far perfer to run a compiled language on the backend then run everything though the JVM or .Net or worse use a scripting language for code I may want to be 
preformant in the future.

GO seems perfect for my use case.

Images are not mine, so don't use them in your website unless you get premission from the orginal authors. 
(Unless it's A.I. since A.I. works do not have copywrite protection via latest Jurisprudence Common Law court rulings.)

Licence Pending, I'm thinking probably MIT or GPL3... but many open source projects have issues figuing out proper monitization stratagies.
As of right now, lets say bussiness/indaviduals making less then $250K a year need not worry about using my code in their projects... after that point,
well then I'll need to think about it I guess. Not really a prority unless this somehow becomes a 'thing'...
